        <div style="width:50%">
            <p>Hello, my name is Victor J. Barajas, a young college student who's curently majoring in Computer Science in a community college. My passion for programming started in college when I transfered from one community college to another. At first, I was majoring in Architecture, but I later decided to change my career and try to take a comptuer science course. While taking the course, I started to love the idea on programming and had this passion to work in a tech company in the future.<br>
            <br>

            Since then, I have focused on learing programming, first learning on Java and then decided to build new websites. However, I wasn't fully confidence on my programming skills, especially after taking the courses. For this reason, I have decided to study in the bootcamp as a Software Developer in order to increase my programming skills and star to work on my own projects.<br>
            <br>
            Not only am I focused to study as a Software Developer, but I also enjoy hanging out with a lot of people, especiallly with my families and friends. But above all, I desire to include my life through my Catholic faith and live it within my social, work, and study environment to become a better person in the future.

      Directions:
        1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content
        2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text
        3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text "Software Developer"
        4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag which will make a horizontal line
        5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______")
        6. Make the word "favorite" italicized
        7. Make an image tag with the src attribute linked to a picture of yourself or of a placeholder image. Make sure you make an alt attribute too!
        8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me"
        9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. You will need to do a search for this text - it is long!
        10. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects"
        11. Create an unordered list with 3 list items that say "Project 1", "Project 2", and "Project 3"
        12. Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me" as text
        13. Create a paragraph that contains a fake phone number, e.g., "Phone: (202) 555-1234"
        14. Create a link tag (<a>) with a direction to mail to a fake email address. This is done by making a regular link, but in the href attribute, put mailto:fake@email.com (this opens up your email program with the TO field already filled out-try it!)

        BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early
          - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/)
          - In your contact me section, make the text "Phone:" and "Email:" bolded
